### This Game is supported by i-phone 11 Pro Max. And developed in X-code 11 and by using Swift 5.1 and brand new [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)

>My very first iOS game build using Swift 4. It's based on this amazing tutorial by Ray Wenderlich: [Your First iOS App](https://www.raywenderlich.com/ios/learn/)
